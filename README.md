# DataScrape for Linkedin Profile to Help with Startup Marketing

## Motivation
LinkedIn has become a major startup marketing hub. This professional networking platform is a gold mine if you want to create a meaningful customer base for your startup. This project was initiated to support the launch of my partner's business by gathering essential data.
We aim to identify potential customers within his business sector by scraping LinkedIn profile URLs using Python.
It's important to note that data scraping regulations can be complex. While this targeted approach can be a valuable tool,  ensure you comply with LinkedIn's terms of service to avoid any potential issues.
